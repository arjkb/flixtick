<p>My name is Arjun, and I'm a software developer from India. Visit my occasionally-updated blog <a href="https://arjkb.gitlab.io/post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>FlixTick is a fun little side-project to solve the problem of keeping track of which movies to watch. Even though most streaming apps out there have this functionality, there are tonnes of streaming apps out there; so this is one list for all of them!</p>
<p>Expect improvements and additional functionality over the next several months!</p>
